# Dynamic Formik Forms 📃 ✍️

Testing out building dynamic forms utilzing [Formik](https://formik.org/) amd [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup).

## Idea/Motivation

Forms and form validation are hard. Formik and Yup help to make the validation part easy. But what about when your forms are dynamic based on data from an API? That's what I'm trying to figure out!

## Resources

- My main inspiration so far was from a [GitHub issue comment](https://github.com/jquense/yup/issues/559#issuecomment-518953000) and the [respective codesandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/clever-snyder-1u410?fontsize=14). Of course, I have a different use case/json structure so I'm creating logic to work for my specific use case.
